## Fact-Checking Approach

1. Identify claims that require verification
2. Cross-check with reputable sources
3. Remove or rephrase uncertain statements
4. Avoid speculation and hallucinations
5. Prefer conservative, well-supported wording

## Example

Claim: "Remote work always increases productivity"
Status: Incorrect (overgeneralization)

Correction: "Remote work can increase productivity when supported by good processes and communication."
